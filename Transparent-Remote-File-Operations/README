#Transparent Remote File Operations

Run "make" in tcp-sample and interpose directories to build 
the programs.

The tools directory has a few programs we will be using to test. These are binary-only tools that operate on the local filesystem.  You will make them operate across the network by interposing on their C library calls. Run any of these tools without arguments for a brief message on how to use it. These binaries should work on x86 64-bit Linux systems (e.g., unix.andrew.cmu.edu servers).  

To use the interposing library, try (if using BASH shell):
```bash
	LD_PRELOAD=./interpose/mylib.so ./tools/440read README
```
or (if using CSH, TCSH, ...):
``` bash
	env LD_PRELOAD=./interpose/mylib.so ./tools/440read README
```

You should see a message indicating the open function in the interpositon library was called.  

Note that the 440tree tool uses the getdirtree function implemented in libdirtree.so in the lib directory. Please add the absolute path of this directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH to make sure that the system can find the library, e.g. on BASH:
``` bash
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;$PWD/lib"
```
or if using CSH, TCSH, ...:
``` bash
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;$PWD/lib"
```
