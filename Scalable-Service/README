#Scalable Service
The main classes (Cloud, ServerLib, Database, ClientSim) and the sample database file (db1.txt) are in the lib directory.  

To build server, ensure your CLASSPATH has the lib and src directory included.  Then run make in the src directory.

To run the src, try:
``` bash
	java Cloud 15440 lib/db1.txt c-2000-1 12
```
This will launch the "Cloud" service, load the database with the items in lib/db1.txt, and start simulating clients arriving at a constant rate every 2000 ms.  A single instance of the src Server will b erun as a "VM" (actually a spearate process).
